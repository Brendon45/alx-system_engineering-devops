Engineering Devops Directories

what is an executable file (program)?

they are files that contain instructions to perform specific tasks
they are written in programming languages such as C++, C, Python and others
they can directly be executed by the operating system.
e.g. the /bin directory contains all system-wide executable files like ls, mkdir, touch, pwd
inside these files are defined rules and instructions that tells the computer what to do if any of these files are executed.
the computer understands to list all files and directories when the ls file is executed.
what are the types of executable programs? compiles executable programs

Compiled executable files are created from programming languages like C, C++, Rust, among others and compiled into machine code, which is specific to the processor architecture, and stored in an executable binary file. The compiled binary file contains the instructions that the computer's processor can directly execute.
interpreted executable programs

they contain human readable instructions which are then interpreted and by an interpreted program like shell, zsh among others. they are written in interpreter languages like Python, scripting languages, Perl, Ruby and they need an interpreter program to run their codes.
are all executable programs files? YES

is it possible to create executable programs myself? YES

This repository contains interpreted executable programs, written by me to perform specific functions.
These executable files are organized into directories per their functions.
